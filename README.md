# Tidying_NFLfastR
Creating tidy data to work with data frames from nflfastR in R 


In this repository, I work with data from nflfastR package available on R. This dataset has play-by-play rows from the season of 1999 until the current or last season of the National Football League (NFL). This package is presented at @nflverse in Github. 
I'm not an advanced data scientist or programmer, my formal experience with programming was only one- my master's degree project using Python to study soil microorganisms and build up an open source automated microscope- available in another repository in this profile. 
Well, that preamble aimed to expose the fact that I'm not a programmer, so my code is not so fluid like many others in Github, but I believe my code can help people whom use R (especially in the context of sport's analysis) just for fun. 
I did not create any function (although they can facilitate the analyses), because they would have complicated the things (i.e be time consuming) for people like me to create.
